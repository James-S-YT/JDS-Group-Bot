### üßëüèª‚Äçüíª **Pull Request (PR) procedure**

**PR Steps**:-
1. **Fork** the repository.

2. **Make changes** and **commit it** to a feature branch.

    üîπ **Feature branch** => name: `feature-featureName`.

    üîπ **Issue Branch** => name: `issue-issueName` Or `issue-issueID`. ( like for bug fixes or other issues)

3. Make a **PR** from your `feature/issue` branch to `development` branch.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:- _Feature and issue branches are temporary branches, so after the merge (successful PR) the feature branch will be deleted._
